### Notes for developers
- In real life, you won't find things like iron ore(if so, they're rare). Instead, you will find ores, 
  which consist of many different ores but in smaller amounts(such as hematite). These ores can then be extracted<br>
  in specialized machines.
- Basic procedure to obtain ingot from classic ore is following:
  - Obtain the ore
  - Crush it in the crusher(obtain dust)
  - Melt the dust and cast it into form of ingot
  - Tada! You've got an ingot!
